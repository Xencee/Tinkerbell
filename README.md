Projects for class or from personal study

These are just a collection of codes or programs I worked on for a class submission or from a personal project. The codes may not be pretty right now, and I guaratee there are better ways of getting them to work, but, the hope is that they will get better and more succint as time goes on. 

I welcome feedback. If you have pointers or advice, please hit me up!

Thanks.
